## Webscraping Practice

- Taking the reviews for my local climbing shop Dick's Climbing, to get an impression of how positive they are (Disclaimer: they're very strong!)
    - Using Python to iterate through a JSON file, taken from their website
    - Exploring this data to get a view of the spread of reviews
    - Created separate dataframes of the comments for different star ratings 
    - Using nltk to analyse the language of these comments - does it vary from positive to less positve reviews?
